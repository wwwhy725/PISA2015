# Project in data analysis lesson
To be concrete, there are 2 tasks in all.
- Given some data about the evaluation of over 40,000 students around the world, I'm expected to select some of the total 428 features and use them to predict whether a student will repeat a year. Any packages are prohibited except numpy and pandas.
- Data on over 6000 students' mathematical proficiency assessment is given. I'm expected to re-select features and train different models to predict other students' mathematical proficiency.
